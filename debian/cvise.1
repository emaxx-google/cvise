.PP
C\-Vise
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
INTERESTINGNESS_TEST
Executable to check interestingness of test cases
.TP
TEST_CASE
Test cases
.SS "options:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-n\fR N, \fB\-n\fR N
Number of cores to use; C\-Vise tries to automatically
pick a good setting but its choice may be too low or
high for your situation
.TP
\fB\-\-tidy\fR
Do not make a backup copy of each file to reduce as
file.orig
.TP
\fB\-\-shaddap\fR
Suppress output about non\-fatal internal errors
.TP
\fB\-\-die\-on\-pass\-bug\fR
Terminate C\-Vise if a pass encounters an otherwise
non\-fatal problem
.TP
\fB\-\-sllooww\fR
Try harder to reduce, but perhaps take a long time to
do so
.TP
\fB\-\-also\-interesting\fR EXIT_CODE
A process exit code (somewhere in the range 64\-113
would be usual) that, when returned by the
interestingness test, will cause C\-Vise to save a copy
of the variant
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Print debug information (alias for \fB\-\-log\-level\fR=\fI\,DEBUG\/\fR)
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-level\fR {INFO,DEBUG,WARNING,ERROR}
Define the verbosity of the logged events
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR LOG_FILE
Log events into LOG_FILE instead of stderr. New events
are appended to the end of the file
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-give\-up\fR
Don't give up on a pass that hasn't made progress for
50000 iterations
.TP
\fB\-\-print\-diff\fR
Show changes made by transformations, for debugging
.TP
\fB\-\-save\-temps\fR
Don't delete \fI\,/tmp/cvise\-xxxxxx\/\fP directories on
termination
.TP
\fB\-\-skip\-initial\-passes\fR
Skip initial passes (useful if input is already
partially reduced)
.TP
\fB\-\-skip\-interestingness\-test\-check\fR, \fB\-s\fR
Skip initial interestingness test check
.TP
\fB\-\-remove\-pass\fR REMOVE_PASS
Remove all instances of the specified passes from the
schedule (comma\-separated)
.TP
\fB\-\-start\-with\-pass\fR START_WITH_PASS
Start with the specified pass
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-timing\fR
Do not print timestamps about reduction progress
.TP
\fB\-\-timestamp\fR
Print timestamps instead of relative time from a
reduction start
.TP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR [TIMEOUT]
Interestingness test timeout in seconds
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
Don't cache behavior of passes
.TP
\fB\-\-skip\-key\-off\fR
Disable skipping the rest of the current pass when 's'
is pressed
.TP
\fB\-\-max\-improvement\fR BYTES
Largest improvement in file size from a single
transformation that C\-Vise should accept (useful only
to slow C\-Vise down)
.TP
\fB\-\-pass\-group\fR {all,binary,opencl\-120,delta}
Set of passes used during the reduction
.TP
\fB\-\-pass\-group\-file\fR PASS_GROUP_FILE
JSON file defining a custom pass group
.TP
\fB\-\-clang\-delta\-std\fR {c++98,c++11,c++14,c++17,c++20,c++2b}
Specify clang_delta C++ standard, it can rapidly speed
up all clang_delta passes
.TP
\fB\-\-clang\-delta\-preserve\-routine\fR CLANG_DELTA_PRESERVE_ROUTINE
Preserve the given function in replace\-function\-defwith\-decl clang delta pass
.TP
\fB\-\-not\-c\fR
Don't run passes that are specific to C and C++, use
this mode for reducing other languages
.TP
\fB\-\-renaming\fR
Enable all renaming passes (that are disabled by
default)
.TP
\fB\-\-list\-passes\fR
Print all available passes and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show program's version number and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-commands\fR COMMANDS, \fB\-c\fR COMMANDS
Use shell commands instead of an interestingness test
case
.TP
\fB\-\-shell\fR SHELL
Use selected shell for the \fB\-\-commands\fR option
.TP
\fB\-\-to\-utf8\fR
Convert any non\-UTF\-8 encoded input file to UTF\-8
.TP
\fB\-\-skip\-after\-n\-transforms\fR SKIP_AFTER_N_TRANSFORMS
Skip each pass after N successful transformations
.TP
\fB\-\-stopping\-threshold\fR STOPPING_THRESHOLD
CVise will stop reducing a test case once it has
reduced by this fraction of its original size. Between
0.0 and 1.0.
.SS "available shortcuts:"
.IP
S \- skip execution of the current pass
D \- toggle \fB\-\-print\-diff\fR option
